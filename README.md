# MS PixelPulse — Blogger Post HTML Archive

This repository stores the **HTML source for my Blogger posts** published on **MS PixelPulse**.  
I use it as a clean, version-controlled place to draft, refine, and reuse blog content before publishing.

## What this repo is for
- ✅ **Blog post HTML drafts** (formatted + ready to paste into Blogger)
- ✅ **Reusable components** (callouts, sections, buttons, image blocks, etc.)
- ✅ **Content iterations** tracked with Git (history of edits and improvements)
- ✅ **SEO + readability** improvements (headings, structure, mobile-friendly layout)

## What I do here (my workflow)
1. Draft the article in clean HTML (with consistent styling + structure)
2. Add image blocks (Blogger-hosted images) + responsive formatting
3. Preview and polish for readability (especially on mobile)
4. Publish on Blogger, then store the final version here for reference

## How the files are organized
Typical structure (may vary as the repo grows):

- `/posts/` — final HTML versions of published posts  
- `/drafts/` — work-in-progress articles  
- `/snippets/` — reusable HTML sections (CTA blocks, TL;DR cards, dividers, etc.)  
- `/assets/` — optional local assets (notes, thumbnails, references)

## Why this is useful (for employers)
This repo demonstrates how I:
- Write **structured, engaging content** with a clear information hierarchy
- Build **clean, reusable HTML layouts** optimized for Blogger publishing
- Apply **UX thinking** (scannability, sections, callouts, mobile-first readability)
- Maintain **professional workflows** (version control, consistency, documentation)
